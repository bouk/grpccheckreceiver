This receiver performs health checks against gRPC endpoints using the standard [gRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/health-checking/).

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
- `targets`: A list of gRPC targets to health check. Each target requires:
  - `endpoint`: The gRPC endpoint in the form `host:port`.

The following settings are optional:
- `collection_interval` (default = `60s`): How often to perform health checks.
- `targets[].service` (default = `""`): The service name to query. An empty string checks overall server health.
- `targets[].tls`: TLS client configuration. By default, TLS is enabled. Use `tls.insecure: true` for plaintext connections.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  grpccheck:
    collection_interval: 30s
    targets:
      - endpoint: localhost:50051
        tls:
          insecure: true
      - endpoint: example.com:443
        service: "my.service"
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml)
